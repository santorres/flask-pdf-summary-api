        "The bootcamp curriculum is divided into two phases: Foundations and Specialist. Each phase lasts for 8 weeks. The curriculum covers various topics such as Software Development, Cloud Engineering, Quality Engineering, and Data Engineering. The timings may vary depending on individual learners, and the coaches ensure full coverage of all areas. The bootcamp can be delivered remotely or in a hybrid working style. In-person weeks are prioritized for coaching, workshops, and events. For the Software Development Specialist Track, there is an additional requirement to attend in-person for the final project. The curriculum in Phase 1 focuses on Modern Software Engineering Foundation, covering topics like Python, engineering practices, database-backed web applications, and cloud deployment.",
        "This document discusses various networking concepts and the use of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI-CD) in software development teams. It also mentions a project where learners work in teams to build an application using agile processes. The document then outlines different specialist tracks for learners, such as software development, cloud engineering, quality engineering, and data engineering. It provides an overview of the curriculum for software development, including modules on JavaScript and web applications. Finally, it discusses a project where learners operate as an agile team to develop a project using a new language and stack.",
        "This document outlines the curriculum for a Cloud Engineering module. It includes various workshops and projects aimed at providing learners with hands-on experience in deploying applications to the cloud using different tools and technologies. The module covers topics such as containers, CI/CD, serverless architecture, infrastructure as code, orchestration using Kubernetes, securing cloud applications, and resolving reliability issues. Coaches are available to support learners throughout the process.",
        "The document outlines two curriculum phases: Quality Engineering and Data Engineering. In the Quality Engineering module, learners will gain skills in Java programming, testing, and automation. They will also learn about software development lifecycle and agile approaches. The module includes exercises, projects, and workshops to support their learning. The Data Engineering module focuses on data analysis and processing. Learners will work on a data analysis project, using Python libraries and SQL to analyze and visualize data. Coaches will be available to provide support throughout the modules. The document also mentions a graduation celebration and includes a schedule for each module.",
        "This document outlines a curriculum for a data engineering module. It includes various topics such as querying databases, data extraction and loading, batch processing, data warehousing, stream processing, and a final project. The curriculum includes structured challenges, ad-hoc sessions, and support from coaches. The overall goal is to develop data engineering skills and apply them to real-world scenarios."
