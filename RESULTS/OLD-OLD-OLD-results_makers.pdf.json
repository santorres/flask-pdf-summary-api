        "The bootcamp curriculum is divided into two phases: Phase 1 (8 weeks) and Phase 2 (8 weeks). In Phase 1, the modules taught are Modern Software Engineering Foundation, Quality Engineering, Data Engineering, and Cloud Engineering. The specific timings for each module are not mentioned, but it is stated that the week-by-week timings can vary. \n\nIn the Modern Software Engineering Foundation module, learners will be introduced to Python programming and will learn to manipulate files and directory structures, use Git for version control, and write procedural programs. The objective of this module is to provide a foundation in modern software engineering practices. Emotional intelligence and wellbeing workshops are also included in this phase.\n\nIn the Quality Engineering module, learners will learn about the four key engineering practices: test-driven development, program design, debugging, and pair programming. They will work on exercises and projects to train these practices.\n\nIn the Data Engineering module, learners will learn to design and use multi-table databases, query databases using SQL, and integrate a relational database into a web application.\n\nIn the Cloud Engineering module, learners will learn about deploying code and how it runs on a cloud platform. The specific objectives and approach for this module are not mentioned.\n\nThe programming language taught in the bootcamp is Python, as it is mentioned in the Modern Software Engineering Foundation module. Other programming languages are not mentioned.\n\nThe bootcamp offers both remote and on-site options. For apprenticeships, the bootcamp is delivered remotely. For other learners, they can choose to study fully remote or in a hybrid working style. In the hybrid option, there are specific weeks where learners are required to be on-site for coaching, workshops, and events. The final project for the Software Development Specialist Track is also conducted in-person.\n\nOverall, the bootcamp curriculum focuses on providing a foundation in modern software engineering practices, quality engineering, data engineering, and cloud engineering. Python is the main programming language taught, and there are options for remote or on-site learning.",
        "The bootcamp covers various modules related to networking concepts, continuous integration and deployment (CI-CD), agile software development, and specialist tracks in software development, cloud engineering, quality engineering, and data engineering. The exact modules, duration, and order may vary. The bootcamp teaches programming languages such as JavaScript and Swift, and focuses on building web applications and mobile applications. Learners work on projects and are supported by coaches throughout the bootcamp.",
        "The bootcamp offers modules in web development, cloud engineering, and securing cloud applications. In the web development module, learners build a native mobile application connected to their web backend. The cloud engineering module covers topics such as containerization, CI/CD, serverless architecture, AWS deployment, infrastructure as code, orchestration using Kubernetes, and securing cloud applications. Each module lasts for one week, with the exception of the final project weeks which span two weeks. The objectives of each module include gaining practical experience, learning agile processes, test-driven development, and engineering skills. The programming languages taught are not explicitly mentioned in the text. Coaches are available to help address learning obstacles, and there are workshops, retrospectives, and resources provided to support the learners' work.",
        "The bootcamp offers two modules: Quality Engineering and Data Engineering.\n\nIn the Quality Engineering module:\n- The module lasts for 8 weeks.\n- The objectives include learning Java programming skills, software testing methods, and automated testing approaches.\n- Java programming language is taught.\n- Learners will work on exercises and projects to apply their knowledge and generate evidence and reports.\n- Other topics covered include data-driven testing, static analysis, performance testing, and security testing.\n\nIn the Data Engineering module:\n- The module lasts for 3 weeks.\n- The objective is to learn data analysis and processing using SQL.\n- Python programming language is taught, specifically using libraries such as Jupyter, Pandas, and matplotlib.\n- Learners will work on a data analysis project and build a metrics dashboard using SQL.\n\nBoth modules provide coaching support, retrospective sessions, and opportunities for collaboration and communication within a team. The bootcamp also includes a graduation celebration.",
        "This bootcamp offers modules in database design, SQL for data analysis, dashboard and metric design, analytical databases, batch processing, data warehousing, stream processing, and a final project. Each module lasts for one week. The objectives of each module include learning how to extract, transform, and load data from different sources, developing scheduled batch-processing pipelines on live Cloud data, designing and building data warehouse models, and developing stream-processing pipelines for near real-time insights. The programming languages taught are SQL, and frameworks such as Apache Spark and Kafka. The bootcamp also provides structured challenges, ad-hoc sessions, coach availability for support, and retrospective sessions for reflection. The final project allows learners to apply their skills to a realistic simulated data engineering challenge."
